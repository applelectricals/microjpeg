JPEG compression is a delicate balance between file size and image quality. This guide covers professional techniques for optimal compression.

## Understanding JPEG Compression

JPEG uses lossy compression, which means some image data is permanently removed to reduce file size. However, with the right techniques, you can achieve significant size reductions while maintaining visually acceptable quality.

## Key Factors

- Compression Quality Setting: The most important factor
- Image Content: Photos with gradients compress better
- Color Space: RGB vs CMYK affects compression
- Image Dimensions: Larger images offer more flexibility

## Best Practices

1. Choose the right quality setting (80-90% for web)
2. Resize to target dimensions first
3. Use progressive JPEG for web
4. Consider WebP for modern browsers
