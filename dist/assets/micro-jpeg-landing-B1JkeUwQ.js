You can add a description to the \`${$}\` by passing a \`${Ke}\` component as a child, which also benefits sighted users by adding visible context to the dialog.

Alternatively, you can use your own component as a description by assigning it an \`id\` and passing the same value to the \`aria-describedby\` prop in \`${$}\`. If the description is confusing or duplicative for sighted users, you can use the \`@radix-ui/react-visually-hidden\` primitive as a wrapper around your description component.

Image compression also plays a role in SEO, as efficiently compressed images contribute to faster page speeds and improve your website's search engine ranking."},{question:"What file formats does Micro JPEG support for image compression?",answer:"Micro JPEG supports over 13 input formats including JPEG, PNG, WebP, AVIF, TIFF, SVG, BMP, GIF, ICO, and RAW formats (CR2, NEF, ARW, DNG, ORF, RW2, PEF, SRW, RAF). You can compress to popular web formats like JPEG, PNG, WebP, and AVIF for optimal web performance."},{question:"Is the privacy of my images ensured?",answer:"Absolutely! Your privacy is our top priority. All uploaded images are automatically deleted from our servers within 24 hours. We use enterprise-grade security measures to protect your data during processing.

We offer both a user-friendly web interface and a powerful API for developers, supporting batch processing, format conversion, and advanced compression algorithms."},{question:"Why did you create Micro JPEG?",answer:"We created Micro JPEG to solve the growing problem of slow-loading websites caused by large image files. With the increasing importance of page speed for SEO and user experience, we wanted to provide the most advanced compression technology that maintains visual quality while dramatically reducing file sizes. Our goal is to make the web faster, one image at a time."}],Compression:[{question:"How much compression can I expect?",answer:"Micro JPEG typically achieves 60-80% file size reduction while maintaining excellent visual quality. The exact compression ratio depends on your original image format, quality settings, and content type. Our advanced algorithms are specifically optimized for web images and often outperform other compression services."},{question:"What's the difference between lossy and lossless compression?",answer:"Lossy compression removes some image data to achieve smaller file sizes, which may slightly reduce quality but is often imperceptible. Lossless compression reduces file size without any quality loss by optimizing how the data is stored. Micro JPEG offers both options, allowing you to choose based on your specific needs."},{question:"Can I compress images in bulk?",answer:"Yes! Premium users can upload and compress multiple images simultaneously with our batch processing feature. You can also download all compressed images as a single ZIP file. Free users can compress one image at a time, while Premium users can process up to 5 images concurrently."},{question:"Do you support RAW image formats?",answer:"Yes, we support popular RAW formats including CR2 (Canon), NEF (Nikon), ARW (Sony), DNG (Adobe), and others. RAW files are converted to web-optimized formats like JPEG or PNG with professional-grade processing to maintain the highest possible quality."}],API:[{question:"How do I get started with the Micro JPEG API?",answer:"Getting started is simple!

The plugin is lightweight and optimized for minimal impact on your WordPress installation."},{question:"Can I optimize existing images in my media library?",answer:"Yes! The plugin includes a bulk optimization feature that lets you compress all existing images in your media library with just a few clicks. You can select specific images or optimize your entire library, and track the progress in real-time."},{question:"Is the WordPress plugin free?",answer:"The plugin itself is free to install, but it uses your Micro JPEG API quota.
